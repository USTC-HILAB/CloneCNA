MATLAB Compiler

1. Install MCR 

. Verify the MATLAB Compiler Runtime (MCR) is installed and ensure you    
  have installed version 8.1 (R2013a).   

. If the MCR is not installed, do the following:
  (1) enter
  
      >>mcrinstaller
      
      at MATLAB prompt. The MCRINSTALLER command displays the 
      location of the MCR Installer.

  (2) run the MCR Installer.

Or download the Linux 64-bit version of the MCR for R2013a from the MathWorks Web site:

2. Run CloneCNA softwares

"run_CloneCNA.sh" is a shell script for temporarily setting environment variables and executing CloneCNA programs.
Before using the shell script, users need to make it executable by using the following command:

chmod +x run_CloneCNA.sh CloneCNA


Usage: 
./run_CloneCNA.sh <MCRDIR> <TumorCountFile> <NormalCountFile> <TumorDepthFile> <gcFile> <outputDir> <plotDir>

Arguments:
	MCRDIR:               The directory where version 8.1 of MCR is installed or the directory where MATLAB is installed on the machine
	TumorCountFile:       Tumor read counts file generated by ExomeSeqMiner
	NormalCountFile:      Normal read counts file generated by ExomeSeqMiner
	TumorDepthFile:       Tumor allelic read depths file generated by ExomeSeqMiner
	gcFile:               GC file generated by ExomeSeqMiner
	outputDir:            The directory to save CloneCNA results
	plotDir:              The directory to save the plots of results

Example:
	./run_CloneCNA.sh /usr/local/MATLAB/MATLAB_Compiler_Runtime/v81 /path/to/tumor.count /path/to/normal.count /path/to/tumor.depth /path/to/target.gc /path/to/output /path/to/plot
