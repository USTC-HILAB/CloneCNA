CloneCNA: detecting subclonal somatic copy number alterations in heterogeneous tumor samples from whole-exome sequencing data.

(1)If you have Matlab installed in your machine, you are golden. Run CloneCNA according to the following instructions.

Usage: 
CloneCNA(TumorCountFile, NormalCountFile, TumorDepthFile, gcFile, outputDir, plotDir);

Arguments:
	TumorCountFile:       Tumor read counts file generated by ExomeSeqMiner
	NormalCountFile:      Normal read counts file generated by ExomeSeqMiner
	TumorDepthFile:       Tumor allelic read depths file generated by ExomeSeqMiner
	gcFile:               GC file generated by ExomeSeqMiner
	outputDir:            The directory to save CloneCNA results
	plotDir:              The directory to save the plots of results

Example:
	CloneCNA('/path/to/tumor.count', '/path/to/normal.count', '/path/to/tumor.depth', '/path/to/target.gc', '/path/to/results', '/path/to/plots');

If you are new to CloneCNA, run the program on a test data to learn more by using the following command:
example()

(2)If Matlab is not installed in your machine, please refer to "readme.txt" file in "executables" directory to learn details of using CloneCNA.
